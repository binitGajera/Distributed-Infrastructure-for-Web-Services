# Distributed System Project

This project handels SOAP requests and SOAP responses from servers and clients. The communication is network based and the client is expected to request an action which is supposed to be executed by servers under efficient time and load. The servers that perform that action will take on that action and provide appropriate response back to the client if the server's load is less than the threshold that has been devised.

## Code

All modules of the project are coded in JAVA and uses Spring Hibernate Framework for handling requests and maintaining communication. Since, the communication uses SOAP, the *wsdl* file is also generated by the application and communicated through servers and clients for identification and verification of actions.

There are 4 servers, 1 service discovery and 1 load balancer in the project. All of them communicate with each other using the local network. It might not be possible to run this code in your system since the code files have hard coded the IP addresses of the local machines on which the corresponding module was running. Hence, to run this code, you might have to change the IP address in each module to create the communication.

* Eclipse IDE
* Spring boot framework
* Maven plugin
* Java version 8

## Design

The above figure shows the design of the project and the flow of the requests and response made between each module.

For the load balancing algorithm we are using the Threshold based Load Balancing algorithm.

## Servers

There are currently four actions that can be performed by the system - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.

Each server performs three of these actions so that load balancing and service discovery can be implemented. Since, these actions would definitely not incur excessive load, we have added some definite custom load, like delay in execution, so that the requests can be spreaded across multiple servers as per the load balancing algorithm.
